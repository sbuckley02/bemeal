The BeMeal project for the Spring 2023 semester for GT WebDev

## Installations
To run this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

Link to download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Cloning this Repository
To get this project on your machine (and be able to edit it), you'll need to clone this repository in a terminal window. Specifically, you'll need to run this command:

```git clone https://github.com/sbuckley02/bemeal.git```

## Running the React Application
To run the front-end application, you'll need to run this command to reach the folder with the React app:

```cd bemeal/bemeal-client```

If you're running the application for the first time, you'll need to install any dependencies on your machine. This can be done with this command:

```npm install```

Finally, to run the React application, you can run the following command:

```npm start```


## Running the Node.js Back-End
Running the back-end is a similar process. You'll need to open a new terminal window and run this command to reach the folder with the Node backend:

```cd bemeal/bemeal-server```

Again, you'll need to install any dependencies on your machine. This can be done with this command:

```npm install```

Finally, to run the application, you can run the following command (same as last time):

```npm start```

Note that will have to refresh the front-end window to see any changes from running the back-end.
